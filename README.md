Hello! 
I've finished this test-task. Following the instructions, I did everything that was required - the search bar and the filterю
This API has some peculiarities - the search by ingredients occurs only with the full indication of the name of the ingredient. Whereas a search for the cocktail name looks for word matches.
Therefore, I used an intermediate query when searching for an ingredient - first, the API looks for similar names of ingredients. After that, the user can select the desired one in the list, which drops out below. After that there is a rendering to the page of what was found.
I used dynamic cocktail search - constantly sending API requests. However, given that the application is extremely small, it might be better to upload all data on cocktails to the redux state, and therefore already perform a search. Such a solution would be somewhat faster in terms of code, but it is very narrow for very small amounts of data.
You can add a modal window where the details of the cocktail, its recipe, etc. would be indicated. The recipes are probably not the most convenient measurement system, so in the future you can add a calculator that would automatically change the measurement system at the user's choice.
Plus, the search could be customized more interesting.
Well, the design. I made it as simple as possible. I love interesting and complex designs (you can check my portfolio), but it usually takes a lot more time.

I ask you to excuse me for what I did in the reactant - the instructions say VUE, however in the job description it was indicated that the reactant is also allowed. I have not done any backend, since I am still a clean front, but I want to become a full stack, which is why I sent you my resume.

thanks


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
